			<h3 class="interviewee-name">Ms. Rita Bhandari</h3>
		<div class="article-box">
			<p class="interview-question"> 1. Would you like to share a few things with us regarding your childhood and schooling?</h4>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				Okay, that's a long long way off. It was quite nice but then I did go to a good school. My parents were
able to put me in St. Mary's School. So, I think it was a big help even though it was very difficult for them.
But they just thought that a good education is always very important in life, morethan anything else.
They always put the value that you have to respect people. In our house, we were not allowed to say
“taaw” to our servants also. My father would be very angry.So, from the time we weresmallwe were
told to value other people's work. And that's very important these days because I see people don't want
to respect elder people. And we have always been taught that is important and it's our culture also. So,
it was nice but then I got married very soon, right after school. By the time my results were out I was
married. Then for some years I did not do anything. Then as time passed I got a bit frustrated because
my friends were either studying or working and here I was not doing anything. So, that was how it was. 
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question">2. What was your profession before you became the president of FWEAN? </h4>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				Not any profession. We are entrepreneurs and to become a member of the Women Entrepreneur's Association,
we have to be an entrepreneur ourselves; we have to have our registered business in our own
name and we have to be running that company. So, first I did try a lot of businesses then finally I came
to know about Women Entrepreneur's Association. That time we did not have a federation. One of our
past presidents came to know me and she asked me to join the association. Slowly from there I came to
know how it was to work in an organization. In an organization, it was hard work where you struggle to
achieve the best. That's how I got into the organization and after that there was no looking back.
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question"> 3. How did you get attracted to the field of entrepreneurship?</h4>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				As I told you in the beginning, I got married very early, for many years I did not do any work. I thought
I was capable of nothing. That was what I had always told my husband. And one day he told me about
an institute ‘New Era' in Battisputali. I was resistant and wonderedhow I could study after so many
years?One of my junior friend encouraged me.So, for the first few weeks, I thought God I am not going
to do anything. Then as I attended the class I felt that I was better than most of them. I did very well in
my new pursuit. I was offered to do many other jobs but with the flow of time I realized that i was capable
of giving jobs rather than taking up jobs. So, that's how I started.
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question">4. What kind of obstacles do you face in your professional life?</h4>
			<p class="interview-answer">

			There are opportunities and difficulties everywhere, whether you are a president or not. In your business,
in your study, everywhere there are opportunities and challenges. But if you take challenges
positively then you can turn that into opportunities. Like when I took this position nobody asked me to
be the president”. It's how much you perform, how much you take interest in then people recognize your
capacity and are willing to support you. So, I think there are difficulties because we are a growing organization
and there are lots of challenges. But we are doing quite well. 
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question"> 5. In your view, what is the status of female entrepreneurs in Nepal?</h4>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				I think now a day's women should become entrepreneur. In fact, young generation I see so much capacity,
so much knowledge they have.We did our business just by attempting anything, so many failures;
many times, you fall down and you get up, you start again. It's not a thing like you fall, but you have
to learn to stand up again. That's the most important thing. And I see the very bright future for entrepreneur
(especially woman entrepreneur). Few years back when we talked about entrepreneurship,
economic empowerment of woman, and the government alsodidn't listen to us. They only talked about
social empowerment of women. But we always used to say social and economic empowerment should
go hand on hand otherwise it was not possible. In the last few years, now women and government are
all bringing focus on economic development. So, it's a huge opportunity for women, especially women of
course.
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question">6. What kind of work is this organization doing for femaleyouth?</h4>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				We don't just focus on young women as such, but we focus on women as a whole. If they want to
become an entrepreneur, then we give our help. We give entrepreneurship training and help them to
register their business. Without being registered the loan cannot be sanctioned. You know loan is a big
problem for lots of people.

			</p>
			<p class="interview-question">7. What is your expectation from the government for women participation in entrepreneurship?</h4>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				We have been telling the government that we have to focus on women. Though both men and women
who are going to foreign land for employment there would be better opportunities if they were skilled
and had knowledge of their worth. Even staying in the country one can do a lot of things. So, we have
been telling the government that we should learn to focus on women entrepreneurship. The government
is finally working toward this. They are very positive these days.ble of giving jobs rather than
taking up jobs. So, that's how I started.

			</p>
			<p class="interview-question">8. Would you like to share your experience as the president of FWEAN? </h4>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				Well! It has not been easy. There have been many challenges, as I said. But, yes, we did a lot of things.
We used to organize small trade fairs, this time we organized a bigger one.we could have done much 
better, but because of the earthquake and then the blockadeit wasa little difficult. But the next trade fair
we are hoping to make it grand with the hope of the younger people joining us. So, more ideas of more
people come in and we would give preference to these younger people.
According to my experience, we have to do lobbing with the government on lots of issues. We have been
doing that for a couple of years and as a result the entrepreneurship fund was established. Then we
have also been talking about difficultiesto market products. There are the challenges but there are an
opportunities too.
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question">9. You are such a busy person. How do you manage time for your family?</h4>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				In the beginning, it was difficult but now it's not so difficult as my children have grown up and I don't
have to look after them. But then, there are lots of social issues like family programs and things like
that. I have my husband who is very understanding. So, sometimes when I have difficulty he helps me
to sort out. I have been lucky in that field and I am able to manage the things as they come. And again, in
my business I have partners,they also look after a lot of things when I cannot go to the office.
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question">10. What are the future plans of this organization for the upliftment of female entrepreneurs?</h4>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				Aah…. What we have been doing is like we create women entrepreneurs' chapters in all districts. Now
we just have them in 30 districts but we hope to cover all 75 districts of Nepal. So, that is one of the
aims. From Kathmandu trying to do work in other districts is difficult. However women who really support
their district and come up with new programs like training programs, entrepreneurship capacity
building that include women are supported.
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question">11. What kind of suggestions would you like to give to the students (especially young
female students) who think of being entrepreneur?</h4>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				I would be most happy if young female students become entrepreneurs because I see most of them just
want to take up jobs, especially in banks. Most of the students, I think, in good colleges have that capacity
where they could give jobs to other. So, if they can concentrate on that they will begin to earn also.
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question"> 12. What does life mean to you?</h4>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				Highs and lows are there in everybody's' life. But I think on the whole life has been good and you should
always look at things in a positive way. Unless you go through failure you never learn what success
means. So, I think that's the biggest thing everybody should be prepared for. Don't expect results immediately
because many times you may fall, but you must get up and that would be the biggest help.

			</p>
			<p class="interview-question">13. Do you have anything to say which we could not ask?</h4>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				I think you have asked so many questions that I don't think there's anything left. But especially for young people
I would suggest that they be prepared to take up challenges. Now it's a globalized world. Don't just think of going
abroad. Just don't think of taking up cushy job. Yes, a job is necessary but then if possible become entrepreneur.
Help yourself, you will be helping other people also- who are in need. So, try to take up challenges. Don't go for
comfortable and cushy things only. In life if you take up challenges you will always come up as a leader.
