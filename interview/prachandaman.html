		<div class="article-box">
			<p class="interview-question">1.Could you please give a brief background about
yourself and NTB?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				I have worked 32 years in the Civil service within that more
than 2o years I was involved in the tourism sector then fi nally in
partnership with the government and some private sector. Talking
about NTB; NTB is a partnership agency which has been organizing
business to business activities, trade fair, press conference, road
shows etc in order to support tourism development in the country.

			</p>
			<p class="interview-question">2.For how long have you been working in NTB? Is
your job exciting?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				More than exciting my job is rather challenging. Challenging in a
sense that there is nothing in isolation. Due to resource constraints
we have not been able to meet our objectives still but we have
been sensitizing different people in different creative ways within
Nepal.
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question">3. How did the concept of “Tourism year 2011”
evolve?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				Firstly, infl uence from “Visit Nepal 1998” Nepal being the youngest
republic country in the world, so to make Nepal known to the rest
part of the world and bring to their notice its historical change.
Secondly to create Nepal as a tourism oriented country.
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question">4. What are the building blocks of tourism in Nepal?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				There are three pillars as the building blocks of tourism In Nepal;
 • Natural diversity
 • Cultural diversity
 • Ethnicity
			</p><p class="interview-question">5.What plans and policies is NTB going to
implement in future?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				The basic plans and policies that we are going to bring soon are;
 • Broadening the bases of client
 • Addressing the security plan in tourism development
process in coordination with different ministries
 • To mobilize the investor’s investment
			</p><p class="interview-question">6.What programs are currently being formulated
for the upliftment of tourism?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				Recently we are formulating programs like;
 • International promotion
 • Technical support for planning
 • Human resource development
 • Product packaging support like; adventure package,
pilgrimage package, gender base package, age base package etc
are being recently formulated.
			</p><p class="interview-question">7.Has political uncertainty affected the tourism
sector adversely?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				Yes, it has been affecting our advancement. We are losing our
credibility, future planning is diffi cult and there isn’t any situation
where we could make perspective plan.

			</p><p class="interview-question">8.What progress has the tourism sector achieved
in the past decades? Has it been really benefi cial
and rewarding?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				Yes, of course we have been able to establish Nepal as the niche
destination for tourism. Similarly, we could see the realization
of importance of tourism by Nepalese people which shows
endorsement of tourism by Nepalese themselves.
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question">9.Could you please tell us something about home
stay?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				We have introduced this system in order to provide accommodation
facility for the tourists where there are no hotels. Beside the
home stay system we also help the people from rural part to gain
economic benefi t.
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question">10.Lastly, what message would you like to convey
to all the citizens?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer">
				Help to make your place guest friendly. Try to take pride in being
a nepali, appreciate the place and don’t project the country
negatively.
