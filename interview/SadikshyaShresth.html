				<h3 class="interviewee-name">Sadikshya Shrestha</h3>
				<p> Sadikshya Shrestha, Miss Nepal 2010 is
the youngest Miss Nepal winner, and can be taken
as an ideal young girl who gained big achievements
and experiences in a young age. There is no doubt
that she has an inspirational personality along
with her beauty. The young lady, who had also
won the VOW Magazine’s “Top Ten College Women
award” in 2009, still seems quite busy getting
involved in various events in and outside the valley
as well as pursuing her Bachelor’s d egree at the
same time. Sadikshya shared her experiences and
views about different things on the questions we
asked her. </p>	
				<p class="interview-question">How would you define Sadikshya
Shrestha in one sentence? </p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					Although it would be a very long sentence
to describe( laughs ) but I can describe
myself as a girl who wants to learn
everyday with life and the lessons it
teaches me every moment.
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question">What are the things that
you like and dislike about
yourself? </p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					I like some qualities that I have
in me like the patience, ability to
admit my mistakes, courage to
discard some events, and also courage
to say ‘no’ to things that are not
right in my perspective.
The things that I dislike about
myself, “Tyo pani tannai chha”
(laughs). I think that I still lack
the courage to deny some things
even if I want to deny them and
I still need to add and remove qualities
within me to face the world and interact
with different people every day.
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question"> What differences have you experienced
in your life before and after Miss Nepal?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					Before Miss Nepal I used to be a normal girl
who used to attend her classes, come home
on time and also have enough time to enjoy
with her buddies. There was a lot of freedom. 
us to a bright future which may take a long time to fulfi ll anyways.
Therefore, I love to stick to the hopeful side on this matter.
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question">What is the role of today’s youth in the development of Nepal? </p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					I think our young generation always has the love for the country
either they are here or abroad. Today’s youth, even if they are
abroad should come back to Nepal one day and contribute in some
ways to the country. Our country would be better if youth show a
bit more will in their country’s future rather than focusing more on
their own future only. I am hopeful that it will happen one day
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question"> There is trend among youngsters going abroad for foreign
degree which is the main cause of brain drain, but still you’ve
preferred to study here. Why?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
				The trend might have been growing because students might have
found better conditions of studies in abroad countries than in Nepal.
It is good thing to go outside and acquire knowledge but it is even
better to use that acquired knowledge for the betterment of your
homeland rather than staying outside after studies. I chose to
study here because I love to stay with my family and along with
my studies I want to continue my works as well. Studying in Nepal
gives me enough time to do so. But even I might go abroad for my
further studies but even if I go, I will defi nitely return and use my
knowledge here because I love my country. 
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question"> Tell us one thing that will make us remember you?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
				After reading this interview I am sure you will spend few minutes
going through all my points. Some of u might agree and some of u
may not. Some of my answer might bring smile on your face and
some might think that this is exactly what I expected from a Miss
Nepal. Since you have given your time to read my answers, I think
you will remember me.
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question"> What makes you feel proud being a Nepalese citizen?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
				I think our country is blessed with a lot of good things. I like Nepal’s
natural beauty, culture, tradition, historical architectural structures
like durbar square, Dharahara, beautiful Rana Palaces, etc. These
are the things and the reason tourists come here for .Besides that
the brotherhood among each other and the fi ne manner in which a
typical Nepali woman takes care of the entire family also makes me
feel proud being a Nepalese citizen.
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question"> Tell us about your experiences in the miss world contest in
China</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
				The best experience for me was that I was representing my country
in the competition and I felt proud about that. I shared a lot of good
things about our country in front of the other contestants. I also
got a chance to learn many new things. Besides, I also made some
friends like Miss Korea, Miss Mongolia, Miss Macau, etc with whom
I enjoyed and they even showed interest in visiting Nepal.
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question">Controversies have raised often regarding beauty pageants
contest being against the values of our society and culture.
What answer would you like to give to the critics? </p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					I don’t think these beauty pageants are against our culture. In our
culture, we have the practice of praying goddesses along with the
god which represents respect for women in our culture. A man might
go out for work but a woman takes care of the family members and
the home itself and she is basically the homemaker. So, it is high
time that the women take charge and the priority of our society
change with time. Miss Nepal focuses more on development of
women and not on hampering our society and culture in any ways.
So, the main reason behind all those controversies is that our
society is the conservativeness of our Nepali society which I hope
will change one day positively
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question"> To uplift the condition of Nepalese women, what sorts
of effort can a Miss Nepal can contribute? What kind of
activities have you contributed on this regard?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					This is the question which a Miss Nepal is usually asked as soon
as she is crowned (laughs). A Miss Nepal can act as a role model,
have a positive attitude in front of all, get involved in some social
activities and represent herself positively towards the world as a
woman. This can inspire other women as well. Even  I have been
trying many of the things after being Miss Nepal.
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question">Give your perspective on beauty and fashion </p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
				I think beauty lies on the eyes of beholder because different persons
defi ne beauty in their own ways. I believe that inner beauty matters
more than outer beauty and if you fail to maintain your inner beauty,
then your outer beauty doesn’t have much use. On the other hand,
Fashion is all about how you present yourse¬¬lf in front of others
and it differs according factors like family events, time with friends,
etc. The way you present and dress yourself defi nes you a lot but I
prefer to be more comfortable in case of fashion. 
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question">Would you like to get involved in the management or business
fi eld in the future? </p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					Yes defi nitely. Since I am a student of business myself I think I
have or will have required knowledge for it in the future and I think
setting up innovative ideas through business helps to boost the
economy of the country as well. 
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question">What should our Nepalese contestants improve to win
or improve our performance in international pageant
competitions? </p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					The problem with this matter is that people tend to focus only
on the results and not on what kind of facilities for preparations
our contestants usually get for these competitions. Contestants
outside get professional trainers, designers, assistants, sponsors etc
who handle their dresses, jewelry, fi tness, schedules, etc and the
contestant gets enough time to focus for her preparations. Here in
Nepal, we lack all these sort of inputs required for an international
pageant competition and a contestant has to manage most of the
things by themselves which is of course quite hectic. Therefore, our
contestants require some good input and a bit more support if we
really want to succeed.
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question"> Social service has been taken up as a fashion stunt by
celebrities. What your views regarding this?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
				In many cases, we can detect whether it is a publicity stunt or not
by the way celebrities do it. If anyone really feels like doing social
service then they can continue it even after their tenure. I believe
things like celebrity status, popularity, tenure etc doesn’t matter for
a person with a good heart who genuinely wants to carry on social
service. 
				</p
				<p class="interview-question">As we know that you have lots of fans, what is the craziest
(Memorable) incident that you have experienced with your
fans or a particular fan? </p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					Oh yeah! It was quite recently by the way. I was hosting the Coca
Cola’s euro cup contest in NCCS College. One of the students came
up to me and asked me to give my autograph on a thousand rupee
note. I asked him whether he’ll spend the money or not and in reply
he said he’d just frame it and keep it. It was quite bizarre to see
anyone sacrifi cing thousand bucks with an autograph but I liked the
experience.
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question">As a Nepalese citizen, how would you contribute to the
country/ how have you been doing it till today? </p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
				As a Nepalese citizen, I do worry about the situations and current
affairs of the country. Even though, I consider myself a “Hopeless
Hopeful” who is always hopeful that these situations will lead
Nepal to a brighter day at some point of time. On the other hand,
I represented Nepal in programs like miss world, Nepal tourism
year, etc where I had the chance to tell the world about the good
things about Nepal. I think that’s a contribution I have done for the
country. 
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question"> How do you feel about current scenario of our country?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
				Being a conscious citizen of Nepal and a “Hopeless Hopeful” that I
am, I always expect for the better future of my country and always
expect that each event either considered good or bad or big or small
can be signifi cant in bringing a positive change in the country’s
future. It is said that it is the darkest when it is dawn, so I think
whatever disorders have happened in our country may be leading 
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question"> Please convey your suggestions to the young generation of
new Nepal.</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
				Be more positive, be happy, don’t ever be disappointed because you
will not be able to do great things in life, start with small differences
that add to make a big revolution in the society, family, and even in
your life. Just Keep smiling and be positive in life always.
