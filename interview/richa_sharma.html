			<h3 class="interviewee-name"> Interview with Reecha Sharma</h3>
		<div class="article-box">
				<p class="interview-question">1. Why did you choose this career?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer"> Because I was always passionate about it. I always wanted to be an actor since I was 11 years old. I
					used to pressurize my parents to watch newly released movie. I belong to a very dramatic family. I never
					thought of anything else but being an actress. When I was in class six my social studies teacher asked
					me about my aim and I answered that I wanted to be an actress. Then, all my friends gave a surprising
					look and asked me if I wanted to be a Nepalese film actress? (Laughs).</p>
				<p class="interview-question">2. How do you feel being a popular celebrity?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					I feel good because I never worked to become famous but I worked to have a peace of mind, peace of
					the heart, and to feel satisfied at the end of the day when I go to sleep. That’s what I did and that’s what
					made me happy, but then popularity follows.
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question">3. What are your strengths and weaknesses?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					Both my strength and weaknesses is my family. My strength is my family because of them I am here
					where I am. Their continuous support and influence helped me to reach here.
					My weaknesses is I am so emotionally attached to my family, I am not married yet because I just want
					to stay with my family(laugh).
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question">4. How were you in your childhood? Would you like to share your funniest childhood memories?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					I have been pampered by my father as I was the youngest kid among the four daughters. I was raised as
					a princess by my father. So, I had a very beautiful childhood because I got what I wanted, I went to the
					best school, I had the best of clothes, best of food, best of holidays. I enjoyed all the pleasure that a kid
					looks for. I had no pressure for studies (laughs). I was an average student.
					The funniest childhood memory was when my father slapped me once because I was being very Nagy in
					front of my relatives and I peed on my school dress (laugh). My mother tried to calm me down and she
					took me to the photo studio and took a picture with all my wet clothes.
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question">5. How do you spend your holidays?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					I always love to spend holidays in the mountains or onthe beach but that’s not possible always because
					as being in this industry we don’t get proper holidays. Whenever I am off I spend my time at home as I
					am a home buddy. I pamper myself, do facial, Manicure, pedicure, read books and I take a short nap.
				
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question">6. Who is your role model in the Nepalese film industry?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer"> My role model is not just from industry but anywhere in the world. But with time, age and maturity I
					think a role model change. Amazingly in the last 10 years, I have also become a role model to many
					(laugh). I don’t think you have to be popular to be a role model for anyone. So, a role model is one who
					inspires and influences other.</p>
				<p class="interview-question">7. How do you see Nepalese film industry in the future?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">	When we were new comers Nepalese film industry was in a miserable phase but now with the change
					in time and pace and with the good movies like Sano Sansar, Loot, Kagbeni, Kabaddi, thingsare really
					changing very quickly. Technology used for the movie is changing along with this the new directors, producers
					and brilliant actors are coming up. Our industry is growing and growing in the right direction.</p>
				<p class="interview-question">8. How tough is it for the actors to sustain in this industry?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					It is tough for beginners. You need to have a lot of passion, patience, dedication, determination to be
					anywhere not only in the Nepalese film industry. It is very hard to maintain our private life once we
					become a public figure. We not only do films but go to colleges to give classes onMotivation, personality
					development, judge an event, television show, brand endorsement, international show and we get a
					good pay. So, in the present it’s not that tough to sustain in this industry.
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question">9. What are the qualifications to be an actor in the present context? Is academic qualification equally important?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
				
					We know, education is most important in this competitive world. But I don’t think that there are qualification
					criteria for being an actor. I think all you need is passion, patience, dedication and determination.
					Moreover, I think it’s good to be well educated about what you are interested in. So, I went to Paris to
					enhance my acting skill. If you want to be a Nepalese film actor you have to be actor first and then ifyou
					are educated you will be able to handle the media and interact with the mass.
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question">10. Does political instability really affects the Nepalese film industry?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					Yes of course it does. We all know that our country is politically instable, our government changes very
					frequently. Political instability not only affects Nepalese film industry but every industry or field directly
					or indirectly. We can take the example of recent economic blockade, due to which we faced a lot of problem
					in shooting of the movie Loot 2. We faced the problem of transportation due to the scarcity of fuel.
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question">11. You seem to be experimenting with different roles in movies, can you please share those experiences and which role is your favorite one?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					Experimenting with roles? Yes, because I always wanted to do something different whenever I appeared
					on screen. I don’t want to appear as Reecha Sharma but as that character. I always tried to do different
					things sometimes I failed and sometimes I succeeded. I just want to be somebody whom people will
					remember as a versatile actress. So, yes I experiment with different role.
					Well talking about my favorite role,it’s like choosing one from 10 kids. However my favorite role isFooli
					from movie ‘Talakjung vs. Tulke’. I even got the national award for that role.
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question"> 12. How tough were your days during the initial phase of your career?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					Luckily, it wasnot that tough since I started from a TV serial. In 2007, I participated in Miss Nepal before
					that I appeared on the music video of the famous director AlokNembhang. I took my career one step
					forward not like jumping directly as an actress, but i got used to with camera. So, it wasn’t that tough for
					me.
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question">13. In your view, what are the pros and cons of your profession?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					There are many pros and cons. Con is that you don’t have a personal life. You can’t say things openly as you are
					a public figure. Well, talking about pros there are various positive aspects of this industry. We get to explore new
					places; you get to travel a lot (laugh). It opens the door for opportunities. Most importantly it increases the level of
					trust of people in you.
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question">14. Which moment did you realize that the film industry is the best platform for your career?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					There was no particular moment. As I told, I was already in media, tv serials “Gharbeti Ba” & “Housefull”.
					We don’t reach a particular saturation point where we realize that we want to do a movie. There was an
					audition for the movie called first love where they were searching for a new face. There were also great
					actors in the movie like Aryan Sigdel, karma, NishaAdhikari,Binayashrestha and I thought I’ll try my luck
					go and luckily I got the rule.
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question">15. Which sector would you step into if the Nepalese film industry abruptly ends?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">
					If Nepalese film industry abruptly ends I would like to be a housewife and have four/five kids (laughs). I don’t want
					to work always, I just want to relax, look after my children, prepare tiffin for them, go pick up them from school,
					and stick around them.
				</p>
				<p class="interview-question"> 16. What is your message to the youth?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer"> 
					Well, there are lots of messages which need to be conveyed to our youth. We usually judge today’s youth negatively.
						\We wonder why they migrate to foreign countries but “what has the country is given them?” A lot of frustration
					and lack of opportunities. I just want to convey that, you should create a platform for yourself rather than
					waiting for someone to create. I think today’s youth at a very young age has realized this. Today they are fighting
					for everything, they want to stand up, they want to be known, and they want to do a lot of constructive things.
					They have so much energy and I want to tell them don’t gather it just explore it. I want them to believe in themselves
					so that they can make others believe in them.
