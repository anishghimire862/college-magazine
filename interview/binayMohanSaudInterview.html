			<p class="interview-answer">
				<p class="interview-question">1. At first, we would like to know how you got involved in this field?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer"> I am a student of engineering. I completed my engineering in electronic engineering from the University
				of America. I saw an influencing had technology there, the cable internet. From my student days, I had
				an idea to do business related with new technology.
				The cable net was new for Nepal. So, I planned to do business with this technology and discussed about
				it with my friends Sudhir Parajuli and Surendra Shrestha. And, SUBISU was all set for its startup.</p>
				<p class="interview-question">2. How long have you been in this field?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">Implementation of the plan was not that easy. Moreover, it was all about an innovation and a very new
				technology. We initiated SUBISU in 2000 A.D. but it took more than two years to take the license from
				the government. Now, I can say SUBISU has a successful story of 16 years.</p>
				<p class="interview-question">3. Would you like to share a few things with us regarding your work life in SUBISU?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">These glorious of experience of 16 years is all about our friendship rather than partnership, I say every
				year our friendship bond is getting stronger.
				SUBISU so far has worked mixing-up innovation with commercialization. In my view, experience counts,
				but it is not everything. I'd like to say I have a wonderful life here.</p>
				<p class="interview-question">4. What influenced you to step into this field?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">I have an enthusiasm to work with new technology. The time when I was going to complete my graduation,
				that decade was all about internet. I liked the concept of cable internet which I saw in US. Then, it
				became my ambition to work in this field as an ISP in Nepal.</p>

				<p class="interview-question">5. Though you are a successful businessman, when did you consider yourself successful?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">Business is all about profit making. And if you ask me about success, I will say my happy customer is my
				success, my resources, staff all are my achievements. The day I will have a handful of satisfied customers
				and rich resources, I will consider myself successful.</p>
				<p class="interview-question">6. In the beginning, what motivated you to become a successful businessman?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">I believed in myself, this became a rich source for me to get self-motivated.</p>
				<p class="interview-question">7. Please suggest some ways as to how a student can obtain this necessary experience?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">Experience brought me to work systematically. My suggestion to the student is to believe in themselves.
				If you want to do anything just start and take your first step. Be a risk-taker and believe in your work,
				work-hard "Success COMES from hard work".</p>
				<p class="interview-question">8. What skills do you think are required for this profession?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">If you are hard-working person, skill is simple to acquire. There is no limit of skill you must work hard to
				achieve anything.</p>
				<p class="interview-question">9. What do you usually tell people when they ask you what you do?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">Poles apart from being an owner. I always prefer to say I'm an employee at SUBISU, I work in the field of
				cable internet.</p>
				<p class="interview-question">10. What was your profession before you enrolled in SUBISU?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">I worked for Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) Lamjung as an electrical-engineer for 18 months.<br/></p>
				<p class="interview-question">11. What are your likes and dislikes working in the industry?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">I like what I do. I loathe, when people take the office tasks lightly. When they take purposeless leave an
				unmanaged practice. I consider this as work-escaping nature of a worker. I'd like to say that everyone
				must be sincere to whatever they do.</p>
				<p class="interview-question">12. In your opinion, what are the strengths and weaknesses of SUBISU?</p>
				<p class="interview-answer">It is very essential to diagnose the strength and weakness of an organization. I categorized the strength
				here as; -all staff work as a team and the weakness is; -Power dependent technology.</p>
