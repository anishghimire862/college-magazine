			<h3 class="interviewee-name">Laxmi Kumari Poudel</h3>
		<div class="article-box">
			<p class="interview-question">1. Where were you born?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer"> 
				I was born and brought up in Rautahat till my teenage days. After that I came to Kathmandu to study
and train myself for the army club.
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question"> 2. How did your career start?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer"> 
				I used to watch football on TV and was fond of it. There was a ground near my house and I started
playing there. I wanted to serve my country, so I joined the army and got selected in the national football
team, playing for the army club.
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question">3. What is your motivation for becoming a player?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer"> 
				From my school days i loved the game. I received support from my friends and family. Soon my love for
the game turned into passion. My hard work gave one fruitful results and kept me going.
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question">4. What are the merits of becoming a professional player?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer"> 
				The greatest merit is the love which I get from my fans, I am treated as a national hero. Seeing the people
giving me love and respect encourage me. Representing my nation in the international league is an
honor for  me.</p>
			<p class="interview-question">5. What is the demerit of becoming a professional player?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer"> 
				There are various fans who want to meet me and my team players, but we are not able to give each fan
our time. They message me in my face book and call me on my phone but I am not able to reply to each
and every one of them. I have a very busy life and I feel helpless when I am not able to connect with
each one of my fans
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question">6. How has the government helped you in your career?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer"> 
				When my national team is sent to play in the international games, the government pays all our expenses
like lodging and fooding. 
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question">7. What do you expect from your fan in both the winning and losing scenario?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer"> 
				In the winning scenario we have all the love and support from our fans. But when we lose our fans also
lose ,their frustration and anger comes as vulgar and inappropriate words spoken by them discourage 
my team and me. It`s not like we will always win, we have to bear the burden of losing also. I think fans
should be supportive whether we lose or win. 
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question"> 8. Has your professional career affected your personal life?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer"> 
				Being a national player is not an easy job. My parents live in Rautahat and I have my training almost
every day in Kathmandu. I miss my family and I want to spend more time with them but I have a huge
responsibility towards my club and nation so I can only meet them 10 to 15 days a year.
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question">9. How do you feel playing for your nation?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer"> 
				Every individual wants to do something good for the nation. I feel lucky to represent my country at the
international level. Getting a chance to make my country proud gives me a sense of happiness and a
sense of patriotism towards my nation.
			</p>
			<p class="interview-question"> 10. What is the goal which you want to achieve in the near future?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer"> 
				My goals are to bring glory to my country in international level, and inspire women in the game of football
and fulfill the hopes and dreams of my family and fans.
			</p><p class="interview-question"> 11. What is your diet?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer"> 
				As a professional player I have to be in shape always, I donâ€™t consume junk food. Eggs, milk, fruits, vegetables
are my basic diet. I love sea food.
			</p><p class="interview-question"> 12. What advice do you have for the youth seeking to qualify for a sportsperson?</p>
			<p class="interview-answer"> 
				You need to have love and passion for the game. You should not be afraid to dream big. Key to fulfilling
your dream is hard work and consistency. Don`t lose hope and keep moving forward.
