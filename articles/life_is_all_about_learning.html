						Normally I try to avoid dispensing free advice because
						I know how difficult it is to put it into practice.
						And there is nothing more depressing than a good
						advice. But for the time being I can't resist myself.
						So here it goes…… Despite friends and family, youth
						is probably the loneliest period of one's life but it is
						the most exciting and can be a greatly satisfying
						period of life. Try not to plan too much and don't
						worry too much. Every week keep asking yourself,
						”Am I anxious? If yes, why? What is it that I'm
						so anxious about?” Confront the problem in your
						life ahead. Don't ever forget that it's not so much
						money, material and achievement that make your
						life but the people around you and your relationship
						with them. But never underestimate the importance
						of money. It'll always be the most helpful
						and the best friend of yours. So always have some
						amount of it saved with you. Try to gain independence
						in thought and action as much as possible in 
						your life. Preserve your self-respect. You’ll meet a
						lot of people in your life. It’ll never be possible for
						you to build permanent relationship with them except
						with a few loved ones. Sometimes you would
						lose your loved ones. Some will betray your trust
						and hurt you, but remember nothing stops the
						flow of life. They say, “The show must go on” I say,
						“the show will always go on, with you or without
						you” so don't stop anywhere. Develop a healthy
						distrust in people but also learn to trust the right
						people at the right time. Nobody is good or bad all
						the time. You may find the cruelest and ruthless
						one doing kind acts and the kindest and the best
						doing cruel things. Don’t get perturbed by it. Life
						is paradoxical and so are the people. You are also
						one of all the people. Love someone deeply and
						violently. It'll elevate you,will give meaning to your
						life,Lest life becomes meaningless. If it ever happens
						that you open your eyes some day and find
						that the world is a lot more horrible place than you
						ever imagined, don't weep smile.

						You will find solace in
						your love. So find someone and love him/her more
						than yourself. That will give you enough reason to
						stand up to the horror, cruelty and ruthlessness of
						the world. Always be loyal and helpful to your family,
						your brother and sisters. No matter who says
						what, the one who are related to you by blood will
						always be closer to you than anybody else. Take
						care of your health and your body. Don’t drink too
						much and don't smoke. It will greatly reduce the
						quality of your life in later years. Have a steady
						and balanced lifestyle. Draw some sweat from
						your brow every day. You will reap its benefits for 
						all your life. Don’t let your work eat your life completely.
						Give yourself and your family some time. Have
						fun. It's not a crime to have fun and to be happy.
						The greatest regret that most people have at the end of
						their lives is that they worked too hard and never gave
						themselves enough time to live life fully. Don’t ever
						compare yourself with others. Believe me, you are far too
						special than anybody else in the world. Don't
						spend your life to be someone else. It’s your life.
						Take control of it. What else can I say? In future if I were
						to leave a note behind for my son and daughter, before passing away,
						I wouldn’t change a word from the above lines. 
						If you are still reading patiently all that I have written above, 
						I want to make a last point. This is the gist of what I
						have learned all through my life. Get yourself so busy living life that you never feel like
						reading or listening to so much crap for so long.
						Why waste time when life is short !!!
