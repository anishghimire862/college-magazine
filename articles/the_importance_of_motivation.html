						Motivation is one of the most important factors
						in determining the level of success that you will
						achieve. <br/>Motivation is required throughout the
						entire goal process. The following are some key
						reasons why motivation is so important:
					<h4>1. Identifying a goal</h4>
					
						Goals come from a desire to change something
						in your life. You may be motivated by positive or
						negative factors. Maybe you are unhappy with
						some aspect of your life. If this is the case, you
						would identify what you want instead and set
						a goal to achieve it. Alternatively, there may be
						something which you enjoy in life but you would
						like to experience more of it or, there may be
						something which you would like to add to your
						life.
						Whether it is a desire for change, a desire to
						add more or, a desire to add something new, it
						is motivation for improved circumstances which
						inspires the goal.
					
					<h4> 2. Prioritization</h4>
					
						Whatever you want to achieve in life, you will
						need to commit yourself to it and focus your
						energy on it. There is only so much that you can
						do as time and energy are limited resources. As
						you are constantly inundated with things that you
						could do, you need to be able to prioritize your
						activities and focus on the most important tasks. 
						This allows you to achieve your best results.
						Motivation is critical in helping you to determine
						which activities should be prioritized.
					
					<h4>3. Action</h4>
					
						Anybody can draw up a plan but the value of
						that plan will never be known until you put it into
						action. Setting a goal is not enough to achieve it.
						You need to take consistent, decisive and effective
						action to bring that goal to reality. The difference
						between those who consistently take action
						towards theirgo and those who do not, is motivation.
						There will be days when you don’t really
						want to do anything. On these days, it is your high
						level of motivation that will push you through.
					
					<h4> 4. Overcoming setbacks</h4>
					
						One of my favourite books is “The Success Principles(TM):
						How to Get from Where You Are to
						Where You Want to Be” by Jack Canfield. In one
						section of the book, Jack provides a rather amazing
						statistic. He tells us that 94% of all salespeople
						have given up on the sale after the 4th time of
						asking but 60% of all sales are made after the 4th
						time of asking. That means that 94% of salespeople
						miss out on the chance of making the sale
						because they don’t have the motivation to keep 
						asking.
						This can be applied to allgo. How many times have you given up on something just because you hit
						an obstacle? Almost any goal worth achieving is going to require some resilience. You will hit obstacles
						and when you do, you must decide whether you will continue or give up. Motivation will ensure that you
						keep going.
					
					<h4>5. Staying the course</h4>
					
						Many of your most importantgo will require a great deal of time to accomplish. It is easy to lose
						motivation and lose sight of your objectives. If you allow this to happen, you may never reach your goal.
						It requires special kinds of people to keep their eye on the prize for a long period of time and, keep taking
						consistent action towards their goal. What makes these people special is that they are highly motivated
						and they take action to reinforce their motivation on a regular basis.
						A clear vision for life and, effectivego to realize that vision, are essential if you want to live your best
						life. However,go and a vision are only dreams unless you take consistent action to bring them to life.
						To take this consistent action requires motivation. Motivation rarely happens by accident and, when it
						does, it rarely lasts for long. If you want to experience the long-lasting motivation which will help you to
						stick with your most important goal, from conception to achievement, you are going to need to work on
						it. No matter what goal you set, never lose sight of your need for motivation as it will be the one thing
						that will push you through the tough times
