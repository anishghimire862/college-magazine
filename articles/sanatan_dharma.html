					<pre class="article-box">
Mostly, considered as the most oldest, predominant and indigenous religion, of the indian subcontinent,
Hinduism is known to its followers as Sanatan Dharma. Hinduism has no single founder
and is formed of diverse traditions including wide spectrum of locus and prescriptions of daily morality
based on the notion of karma, drama and societal norms. The basic, features include diversity,
lack of compulsion and the richness of the various ways it makes its followers practice its beliefs
and tradition. Taking about the real meaning of Hinduism. Hinduism never compels anyone to go
through any hard and fast rules and regulations. It is very open about following the beliefs and ways
of thinking mentioned in the sared books. There are many weaknesses in the belief of Hinduism,
mostly witchcraft, sati, and taboos on love marriage. Unfortunately these are practised by fake
god men but Hinduism describes God in a very different way. Hinduism is like a river and its followers
are the water molecules. The moment these molecules leave the source, the river gives them their
purpose to always progress towards the destination, the vast infinite ocean. The molecules stumble,
crumble and tumble, but the river shows them the right path. Molecules pass through the beautiful
mountains and cities, sometimes through rocky mountains but the river tells them the value
of happiness and sadness on the path of the journey. The molecules of mountain show their true
identity, it tells molecules that the inner self is all that matters while the external is temporary and
in significant. The molecules may deviate and go through many difficulties but the natural cycle always
brings them back to the river and the river readily leads them to the ocean.

This is the essence of Hinduism; it gives a path, a guiding light to an individual, so that he/she can
merge with the infinite one. It only expresses the identity of the inner self which is untouched by the
external world. It teaches us that every part of life like success, failure, sadness and happiness are an
integral part of one's journey and one shouldn't get influenced, discouraged or distracted by these
forces. There is no definite way to reach the infinite, Hinduism is open and dynamic. It has received invaluable
contribution from great saints, but unfortunately at some time, it has also become corrupted
from fake god men and selfish saints who misinterpret and misguide other primarily for their own
benefits. In a nutshell, the essence of Hinduism is freedom. The teachings of Hinduism can be summarized as
"be morally perfect, experience truth and be free."
